            <p id="about"> <img class="profile-photo" src="images/greatfalls_cropped.jpg"> Hi! I'm Megan, an aspiring web-developer. Two years after graduating from Dickinson with my BA in Middle East Studies, I realized that I wanted to have a career where I was continuously learning and where I had the opportunity to approach problems and tasks in a creative manner. So I decided to switch it all up and head out to Utah for a programming bootcamp: V-School (previously known as Coding Campus.) I'm enrolled in their full-time MEAN-stack program, and looking to return to the East Coast to make some beautiful web applications! </p>

                        <a href="http://challenge.meganfranco.com/#/"><img src="images/projectImages/ChallengeTracker.jpg" class="project-image"></a>
                        <p>This application was inspired by Eric Elliott's rejection challenge on Github. The objective is to try something every day, even if you might fail. Fails are ten points, and wins are one point. Since I'm about to really begin the job search, this would be a great way to put a positive spin on the inevitable rejections coming my way.</p>

                        <a href="http://breakupbot.meganfranco.com/#/"><img src="images/projectImages/theBot.jpg" class="project-image"></a>
                        <p>I started off this project with the concept of "Build something you need" in mind. I wanted to build this for a friend of mine after the second time my group of friends got together around her phone, debating the best ways to breakup with the guy she was seeing. So I figured: "Why not automate it? And I figured that an open-ended 'Do Anything' project would be the perfect time to get started on this idea."</p>

                        <p>This class project involved making a "My Little Pony" fansite using AngularJS. The ponies are accessed and pushed to a database using $http requests and a basic user interface. Not only did I learn a lot about creating an angular site, but I learned a lot about the My Little Pony Universe too. This was wholly unintentional...</p>

                        <p>Like the "My Little Brony" app, the "Poke-Profile uses $http requests to access data, this time using the substantial "Pokemon API". Though this is a simple app, it was a lot of fun to enter random numbers and remember the long-forgotten pokemon of my childhood!</p>

                        <p>"Mom's Shopping List" was one of the earlier projects in the course. The poject's objective is to design a site where items could be added and deleted dynamically. If I ever find the time, I hope to go back and find a way to make the data persist.</p>

                        <p>After using the Pokemon API for various toy apps, our instructor gave us a list of APIs and free creative reign to make an app of our own choosing. I chose the DarkSky API, since I love their iOS app, but I also had to incorportate the google maps API. This was a challanging project, but so far my favorite.</p>

                ...But there's a lot more I want to build! When I have some free time, (and now that I know a lot of the basics of web-dev) I hope to begin to build applications with new languages and frameworks. Checking out React and Meteor are high on my list, but I also want to explore developing in other languages. It was after learning more about Python through Codecademy and Coursera that I decided I wanted to dive full-time into web development. I can't wait to learn more Python, and when I do, I really want to dig into Flask and Django. So, if you can suggest any good resources, please send them my way!
